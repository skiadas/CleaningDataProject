# Getting and Cleaning Data: Smartphone Data Set

Dataset source `http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones`.

Contains experiments carried out on a group of 30 volunteers ages 19-48. Each person performed 6 activities (walking, sitting, laying etc) wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone with an embedded accelerometer and gyroscope. A total of 561 different attributes and sensor signals were recorded. Some preprocessing using noise filters and sliding windows was already performed to the data, as described in the aforementioned webpage.

Further processing was done as part of this assignment, and is described in `CodeBook.md`.

Files included:

- `README.md`, this file
- `run_analysis.R`, a script that reads the data from the web, unzips it and processes it into a tidy set.
- `CodeBook.md`, describes the process used tidy up the data, as well as the format of the resulting tidy set.
- `tidySet.txt`, the resulting tidy set.
